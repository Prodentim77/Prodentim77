## Why Oral Health Needs a New Approach  

Your mouth is a complex ecosystem teeming with bacteria, some beneficial and others harmful.  
When harmful bacteria dominate, it leads to common problems like cavities, gum inflammation, and bad breath.  

Traditional oral care products often disrupt the bacterial balance by killing all bacteria, good and bad alike.  
This can create long-term issues, leaving your oral microbiome vulnerable to imbalance.  

ProDentim changes the game by introducing probiotics and prebiotics that:  

- Support the growth of good bacteria.  
- Restore the natural balance of your oral microbiome.  
- Address the root causes of oral health problems instead of masking symptoms.
